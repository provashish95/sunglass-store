### About Project

I build This project with help of react library 
And also using javascript, Bootstrap Cdn and some raw CSS.

This is a simple glass store website, where users can add item to cart box.

And he/she can  add maximum four items to cart box, if users try more than four items, fetch error message.

After adding glass to cart box user click, choose one for me button for randomly selected glass and The glass store website gives him/her best one.

we have another option on the cart box for deleting items and reset button.
